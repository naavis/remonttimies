Remonttimies
============
A hobby-project raytracer with real-time OpenGL preview of the scene. The name originates from a Finnish raytracing pun.

Requirements
------------
Remonttimies requires the following libraries to run:

* Open Asset Import Library ( http://assimp.sourceforge.net/ )
* GLFW 3 ( http://www.glfw.org/ )
* GLEW ( http://glew.sourceforge.net/ )

_assimp.dll_, _glew32.dll_ and _glfw3.dll_ need to be available for the program to run.

The project is being currently developed with Visual Studio 2013. The libraries are added to the project via Visual Studio Property Sheets.

__NOTE:__ Currently the property sheets define User Macros that point to the relevant library directories. Since the paths to these directories will most likely be different on your computer, you will need to edit the macros by hand. This will be replaced with a more sane solution later.

How to run
----------
The program is simply run by giving the 3D model filename as the command-line parameter:

    Remonttimies.exe foo.obj

The program has only been tested with a few OBJ files so far.

__WASD keys__ move the camera forward, backward and sideways. __R__ and __F__ move the camera up and down. The arrow keys turn the camera. Pressing the __spacebar__ renders the image to _output.ppm_.
