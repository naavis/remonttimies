Requirements
------------
Remonttimies requires the following libraries to run:

* Open Asset Import Library ( http://assimp.sourceforge.net/ )
* GLFW 3 ( http://www.glfw.org/ )
* GLEW ( http://glew.sourceforge.net/ )
* GLM ( http://glm.g-truc.net/ )

The project is currently being developed with Visual Studio 2013. The libraries are included in the project via NuGet packages. _NupenGL Core_ was used instead of _GLEW_ and _GLFW_ because the existing _GLEW_ package refused to work with VS2013. Unfortunately _NupenGL Core_ includes the _FreeGLUT_ library, which is not actually needed. _opengl32.lib_ had to be linked manually to get the project to work.

How to run
----------
The program is simply run by giving the 3D model filename as the command-line parameter:

    Remonttimies.exe foo.obj

The program has only been tested with a few OBJ files so far.

__WASD keys__ move the camera forward, backward and sideways. __R__ and __F__ move the camera up and down. The arrow keys turn the camera. Pressing the __spacebar__ renders the image, shows it on screen and saves to _output.ppm_. Pressing __spacebar__ again hides the rendered image.
